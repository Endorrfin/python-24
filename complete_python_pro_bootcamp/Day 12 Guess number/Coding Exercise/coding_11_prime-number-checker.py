# Prime Number Checker
# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1. Wikipedia

# You need to write a function called is_prime() that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.
# It should return True or False.

# e.g.
# 7 is a primer number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.
# NOTE: 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself, but 1 is not a prime number because it is only divisible by 1.

# Example Input 1
# 73

# Example Output 1
# True

# Example Input 2
# 75

# Example Output 2
# False


# âœ… SOLUTION
def is_prime(num):
    # cheks it a number is a prime number.
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num == 2:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False

    for i in range(3, int(num ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False

    return True


print(is_prime(5))
print(is_prime(73))
print(is_prime(75))
print(is_prime(2))
